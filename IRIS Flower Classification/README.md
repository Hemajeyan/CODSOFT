# Iris Flower Classification

This project uses the Iris dataset to train a machine learning model that classifies iris flowers into three different species: **Setosa**, **Versicolor**, and **Virginica**. The dataset consists of measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, which are used as features for classification.

## Introduction

The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in machine learning and is often used for classification problems. The dataset contains 150 samples from each of three species of Iris flowers (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica). The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify the species of an iris flower based on four input features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

## Dataset

The Iris dataset contains the following features:

- **Sepal Length (cm)**: Length of the sepal
- **Sepal Width (cm)**: Width of the sepal
- **Petal Length (cm)**: Length of the petal
- **Petal Width (cm)**: Width of the petal
- **Species**: Target variable with three classes: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica

The dataset is available from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris) or directly from libraries like `sklearn.datasets`.

## Features

- **Data Exploration**: 
    - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to visualize the relationships between the features and the target variable (species)
    - Correlation analysis between sepal/petal dimensions

- **Data Preprocessing**: 
    - Feature scaling using StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler
    - Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets
    - Label encoding for target species

- **Modeling**:
    - Training and testing various classification algorithms such as:
      - Logistic Regression
      - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
      - Decision Trees
      - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
      - Random Forest

- **Evaluation**:
    - Model evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
    - Confusion matrix to visualize the classification performance

## Model Training

The following machine learning models were trained for classification:

- **Logistic Regression**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Decision Tree**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Random Forest**

Each model was trained using the training portion of the dataset, and hyperparameters were tuned to improve performance.

## Results

- **Accuracy**: X.XX%
- **Precision**: X.XX%
- **Recall**: X.XX%
- **F1-Score**: X.XX

The confusion matrix shows the breakdown of the correct and incorrect predictions for each species class.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how to classify Iris flowers into species based on their sepal and petal measurements using different machine learning models. All the models performed well, given the simplicity and balance of the dataset. However, certain models like Random Forest and SVM outperformed others in terms of classification accuracy.

## Future Work

- Perform hyperparameter tuning using `GridSearchCV` or `RandomizedSearchCV` to further optimize the models
- Implement dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA to improve performance and reduce computational cost
- Explore ensemble methods like `AdaBoost` or `XGBoost` for better classification accuracy
- Develop a simple web interface or API to classify Iris flowers in real-time based on user inputs
